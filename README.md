# Luv
Luv means Learn Using Videos. And is inspired by [Lute](https://github.com/jzohrab/lute-v3) (Learn Using Texts).
Replicating it's features for video captions. Only Youtube videos are supported yet.

Luv is an open source language learning extension that makes Youtube video caption words clickable, and let's you enter and save custom translations, pronunciation and knowledge level from a side pannel. You can also lookup the translations with dictitionaries or translators like wiktionary. Words then appear colored accordingly. Luv also counts how many time you've seen each word.
